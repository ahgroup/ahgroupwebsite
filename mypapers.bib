  journal = {Proc Biol Sci},
  year = {2014},
  volume = {281},
  number = {1787},
  month = {Jul},
  abstract = {Trade-offs between different components of a pathogen's replication
	and transmission cycle are thought to be common. A number of studies
	have identified trade-offs that emerge across scales, reflecting
	the tension between strategies that optimize within-host proliferation
	and large-scale population spread. Most of these studies are theoretical
	in nature, with direct experimental tests of such cross-scale trade-offs
	still rare. Here, we report an analysis of avian influenza A viruses
	across scales, focusing on the phenotype of temperature-dependent
	viral persistence. Taking advantage of a unique dataset that reports
	both environmental virus decay rates and strain-specific viral kinetics
	from duck challenge experiments, we show that the temperature-dependent
	environmental decay rate of a strain does not impact within-host
	virus load. Hence, for this phenotype, the scales of within-host
	infection dynamics and between-host environmental persistence do
	not seem to interact: viral fitness may be optimized on each scale
	without cross-scale trade-offs. Instead, we confirm the existence
	of a temperature-dependent persistence trade-off on a single scale,
	with some strains favouring environmental persistence in water at
	low temperatures while others reduce sensitivity to increasing temperatures.
	We show that this temperature-dependent trade-off is a robust phenomenon
	and does not depend on the details of data analysis. Our findings
	suggest that viruses might employ different environmental persistence
	strategies, which facilitates the coexistence of diverse strains
	in ecological niches. We conclude that a better understanding of
	the transmission and evolutionary dynamics of influenza A viruses
	probably requires empirical information regarding both within-host
	dynamics and environmental traits, integrated within a combined ecological
	and within-host framework.},

  abstract = {Human CMV still remains problematic in immunocompromised patients,
	particularly after solid organ transplantation. CMV primary disease
	and reactivation greatly increase the risks associated with incidences
	of chronic allograft rejection and decreased survival in transplant
	recipients. But whether this is due to direct viral effects, indirect
	viral effects including cross-reactive antiviral T cell immunopathology,
	or a combination of both remains undetermined. In this article, we
	report the novel TCR signature of cross-reactive HLA-A*02:01 (A2)
	CMV (NLVPMVATV [NLV])-specific CD8(+) T cells recognizing a specific
	array of HLA-B27 alleles using technical advancements that combine
	both IFN-γ secretion and multiplex nested RT-PCR for determining
	paired CDR3α/β sequences from a single cell. This study represents
	the first evidence, to our knowledge, of the same A2-restricted cross-reactive
	NLV-specific TCR-α/β signature (TRAV3TRAJ31_TRBV12-4TRBJ1-1) in two
	genetically distinct individuals. Longitudinal posttransplant monitoring
	of a lung transplant recipient (A2, CMV seropositive) who received
	a HLA-B27 bilateral lung allograft showed a dynamic expansion of
	the cross-reactive NLV-specific TCR repertoire before CMV reactivation.
	After resolution of the active viral infection, the frequency of
	cross-reactive NLV-specific CD8(+) T cells reduced to previremia
	levels, thereby demonstrating immune modulation of the T cell repertoire
	due to antigenic pressure. The dynamic changes in TCR repertoire,
	at a time when CMV reactivation was subclinical, illustrates that
	prospective monitoring in susceptible patients can reveal nuances
	in immune profiles that may be clinically relevant.},

  abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease with a peculiar feature:
	Upon infection with the causative agent, Mycobacterium Tuberculosis
	(MTB), most hosts enter a latent state during which no transmission
	of MTB to new hosts occurs. Only a fraction of latently infected
	hosts develop TB disease and can potentially infect new hosts. At
	first glance, this seems like a waste of transmission potential and
	therefore an evolutionary suboptimal strategy for MTB. It might be
	that the human immune response keeps MTB in check in most hosts,
	thereby preventing it from achieving its evolutionary optimum. Another
	possible explanation is that long latency and progression to disease
	in only a fraction of hosts are evolutionary beneficial to MTB by
	allowing it to persist better in small host populations. Given that
	MTB has co-evolved with human hosts for millenia or longer, it likely
	encountered small host populations for a large share of its evolutionary
	history and had to evolve strategies of persistence. Here, we use
	a mathematical model to show that indeed, MTB persistence is optimal
	for an intermediate duration of latency and level of activation.
	The predicted optimal level of activation is above the observed value,
	suggesting that human co-evolution has lead to host immunity, which
	keeps MTB below its evolutionary optimum.},
