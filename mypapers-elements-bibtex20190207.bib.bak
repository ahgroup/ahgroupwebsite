abstract = {Vaccination is an effective method to protect against infectious diseases. An important consideration in any vaccine formulation is the inoculum dose, i.e., amount of antigen or live attenuated pathogen that is used. Higher levels generally lead to better stimulation of the immune response but might cause more severe side effects and allow for less population coverage in the presence of vaccine shortages. Determining the optimal amount of inoculum dose is an important component of rational vaccine design. A combination of mathematical models with experimental data can help determine the impact of the inoculum dose. We illustrate the concept of using data and models to inform inoculum dose determination for vaccines, wby fitting a mathematical model to data from influenza A virus (IAV) infection of mice and human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) infection of cotton rats at different inoculum doses. We use the model to map inoculum dose to the level of immune protection and morbidity and to explore how such a framework might be used to determine an optimal inoculum dose. We show how a framework that combines mathematical models with experimental data can be used to study the impact of inoculum dose on important outcomes such as immune protection and morbidity. Our findings illustrate that the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity can depend on the specific pathogen and that both protection and morbidity do not necessarily increase monotonically with increasing inoculum dose. Once vaccine design goals are specified with required levels of protection and acceptable levels of morbidity, our proposed framework can help in the rational design of vaccines and determination of the optimal amount of inoculum.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate diagnostic agreement of the QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) test in adult tuberculin skin test (TST) converters in a high tuberculosis (TB) burden setting. SETTING AND DESIGN: We performed a case-cohort study from 2014 to 2016 in Uganda among residents who were not infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Participants were followed up for 1 year, when they were retested to determine TST conversion. All TST converters and a random sample of participants from baseline were offered QFT-GIT testing. RESULTS: Of 368 enrolled participants, 61 (17\%) converted their TST by 1 year. Among 61 converters, 42 were tested using QFT-GIT, 64\% of whom were QFT-GIT-positive. Of 307 participants with a persistent negative TST, 48 were tested using QFT-GIT, 83\% of whom were QFT-negative. Overall concordance of TST and QFT-GIT was moderate (κ = 0.48, 95\%CI 0.30-0.66). Converters with a conversion of 15 mm had a higher proportion of concordant QFT-GIT results (79\%) than converters with increments of 10-14.9 mm (52\%). CONCLUSION: Concordance between TST and QFT-GIT was moderate among TST converters in this urban African population. These findings call for improved tests that more accurately measure conversion to tuberculous infection.},

volume = {16},
year = {2018},
abstract = {Determining the duration of protective immunity requires quantifying the magnitude and rate of loss of antibodies to different virus and vaccine antigens. A key complication is heterogeneity in both the magnitude and decay rate of responses of different individuals to a given vaccine, as well as of a given individual to different vaccines. We analyzed longitudinal data on antibody titers in 45 individuals to characterize the extent of this heterogeneity and used models to determine how it affected the longevity of protective immunity to measles, rubella, vaccinia, tetanus, and diphtheria. Our analysis showed that the magnitude of responses in different individuals varied between 12- and 200-fold (95\% coverage) depending on the antigen. Heterogeneity in the magnitude and decay rate contribute comparably to variation in the longevity of protective immunity between different individuals. We found that some individuals have, on average, slightly longer-lasting memory than others-on average, they have higher antibody levels with slower decay rates. We identified different patterns for the loss of protective levels of antibodies to different vaccine and virus antigens. Specifically, we found that for the first 25 to 50 years, virtually all individuals have protective antibody titers against diphtheria and tetanus, respectively, but about 10\% of the population subsequently lose protective immunity per decade. In contrast, at the outset, not all individuals had protective titers against measles, rubella, and vaccinia. However, these antibody titers wane much more slowly, with a loss of protective immunity in only 1\% to 3\% of the population per decade. Our results highlight the importance of long-term longitudinal studies for estimating the duration of protective immunity and suggest both how vaccines might be improved and how boosting schedules might be reevaluated.},
