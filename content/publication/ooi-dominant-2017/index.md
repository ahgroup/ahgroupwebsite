abstract = "Susceptibility and protection against human autoimmune diseases, including type I diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and Goodpasture disease, is associated with particular human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. However, the mechanisms underpinning such HLA-mediated effects on self-tolerance remain unclear. Here we  investigate the molecular mechanism of Goodpasture disease, an HLA-linked autoimmune renal disorder characterized by an immunodominant CD4(+) T-cell self-epitope derived from the alpha3 chain of type IV collagen (alpha3135-145). While HLA-DR15 confers a markedly increased disease risk, the protective HLA-DR1  allele is dominantly protective in trans with HLA-DR15 (ref. 2). We show that autoreactive alpha3135-145-specific T cells expand in patients with Goodpasture disease and, in alpha3135-145-immunized HLA-DR15 transgenic mice, alpha3135-145-specific T cells infiltrate the kidney and mice develop Goodpasture disease. HLA-DR15 and HLA-DR1 exhibit distinct peptide repertoires and binding preferences and present the alpha3135-145 epitope in different binding registers."
