abstract: "As immunology continues to become more quantitative, increasingly sophisticated computational tools are commonly used. One useful toolset are simulation models. Becoming familiar with such models and their uses generally requires writing computer code early in the learning process. This poses a barrier for individuals who do not have prior coding experience."
