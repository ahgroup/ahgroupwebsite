abstract: "
Background. Avian influenza A H7N9 (A/H7N9) is characterized by rapid progressive pneumonia and respiratory failure.
Mortality among laboratory-confirmed cases is above 30%; however, the clinical course of disease is variable and patients at high
risk for death are not well characterized.
Methods. We obtained demographic, clinical, and laboratory information on all A/H7N9 patients in Zhejiang province from
China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention electronic databases. Risk factors for death were identified using logistic regres-
sion and a risk score was created using regression coefficients from multivariable models. We externally validated this score in an
independent cohort from Jiangsu province.
Results. Among 305 A/H7N9 patients, 115 (37.7%) died. Four independent predictors of death were identified: older
age, diabetes, bilateral lung infection, and neutrophil percentage. We constructed a score with 0–13 points. Mortality rates in
low- (0–3), medium- (4–6), and high-risk (7–13) groups were 4.6%, 32.1%, and 62.7% (P trend  < .0001). In a validation cohort
of 111 A/H7N9 patients, 61 (55%) died. Mortality rates in low-, medium-, and high-risk groups were 35.5%, 55.8, and 67.4%
(P trend  = .0063).
Conclusions. We developed and validated a simple-to-use, predictive risk score for clinical use, identifying patients at high
mortality risk."
