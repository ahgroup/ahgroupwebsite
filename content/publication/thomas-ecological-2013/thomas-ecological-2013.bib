 abstract = {Ecology is typically thought of as the study of interactions organisms have with  each other and their environment and is focused on the distribution and abundance of organisms both within and between environments. On a molecular level, the capacity to probe analogous questions in the field of T-cell immunology is imperative as we acquire substantial datasets both on epitope-specific T-cell populations through high-resolution analyses of T-cell receptor (TCR) use and on  global T-cell populations analyzed via high-throughput DNA sequencing. Here, we present the innovative application of existing statistical measures (used typically in the field of ecology), together with unique statistical analyses, to comprehensively assess how the naive epitope-specific CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) repertoire translates to that found following an influenza-virus-specific immune response. Such interrogation of our extensive, cumulated TCR CDR3beta sequence datasets, derived from both naive and immune CD8(+) T-cell populations specific for four different influenza-derived epitopes  (D(b)NP(366), influenza nucleoprotein amino acid residues 366-374; D(b)PA(224), influenza acid polymerase amino acid residues 224-233; D(b)PB1-F2(62), influenza  polymerase B 1 reading frame 2 amino acid residues 62-70; K(b)NS2(114), and influenza nonstructural protein 2 amino acid residues 114-121), demonstrates that epitope-specific TCR use in an antiviral immune response is the consequence of a  complex interplay between the intrinsic characteristics of the naive cytotoxic T  lymphocyte precursor pool and extrinsic (likely antigen driven) influences, the contribution of which varies in an epitope-specific fashion.},
