	We are interested in the dynamics of influenza, both on the within-host level and the between-host level. On the within-host level, we try to gain a better and more quantitative understanding as to what drives the infection dynamics and leads to virus clearance. On the between-host levels, we study the spread and potential control of the virus. Current specific projects we work on are:
		<ul class="list">
		<li>Persistence of avian influenza in the environment</li>
		<li>Adaptive immune responses to influenza</li>
		<li>Dose-dependent influenza infection outcomes</li>
		</ul>
