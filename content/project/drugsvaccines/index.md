We are interested in the impact of drug treatment or vaccination on infection outcomes on the within-host and population levels. We currently work on a project to better understand the potential impact of a future norovirus vaccine on the diseas. In another project, we are studying the impact of anti-influenza drugs such as tamiflu.
