	In collaboration with our departmental colleague Chris Whalen, we use a combination of mathematical models and data to better understand the spread of and potential interventions against tuberculosis, with a focus on African settings. <br>
	We are also working on a model to better understand the dynamics of drug treatment during TB infections of individual patients.
