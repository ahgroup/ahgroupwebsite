Together with collaborators at Emory and Duke University and elsewhere, we are working on better understanding aspects of norovirus within-host and epidemiological dynamics and potential control. Currently, we are collaborating with Dr. Lopman and his group at the Emory and Dr. Koelle and her group at Duke to study the potential impact of a future norovirus vaccine.
