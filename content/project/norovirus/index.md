Together with collaborators at Emory and elsewhere, we are working on better understanding aspects of norovirus within-host and epidemiological dynamics and potential control. Currently, we are collaborating with Ben Lopman, Katia Koelle and Juan Leon at Emory, as well as colleagues from other universities, the CDC and Takeda, to analyze and model data that can inform the development and deployment of a future norovirus vaccine.
