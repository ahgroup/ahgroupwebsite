<p>Like most infectious disease modelers, we have gotten involved in several COVID-19 related projects recently.
A lot of work is done as part of UGA’s Center for the Ecology of Infectious Diseases, most of those projects <a href="http://2019-coronavirus-tracker.com/">can be found here.</a></p>
<p>One project is our visualization of COVID-19 cases/deaths. <a href="https://shiny.ovpr.uga.edu/yact/">This shiny app is here.</a></p>
<p>Lastly, a few projects exist as pre-prints. One analyzes <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025973">mass screening and testing interventions</a> another looks at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.13.20034892">reduction of mortality if containment is not possible</a>, <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3567505">this one analyzes multiple likely airborne transmissions on a bus</a> and <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3563064">this one looks at several transmission events during casual contact</a>.</p>
<p>Dr. Handel also described most of these projects in a recent presentation at GA Southern, <a href="https://www.andreashandel.com/talk/2020-04-gasouthern-covid/">here are the slides from this talk.</a></p>
