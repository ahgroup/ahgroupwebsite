<p>We recently had a few new publications come out: One of the PhD thesis chapters of our former student Brian got published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, and we had a few COVID related papers come out, as well as a few on assorted other infectious disease topics. All publications can be found in the <a href="/publication/">publications section</a> of this page.</p>
