  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: Rapid influenza diagnostic tests that detect the presence of viral antigens are currently used throughout the United States but have poor sensitivity. The objective of this study was to identify if the use of a new highly accurate rapid point of care test would significantly increase the likelihood of guideline consistent care. METHODS: We prospectively recruited 300  students at a university health clinic who presented with cough and 1 influenza-like illness symptom between December 2016 and February 2017 to receive care guided by a rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Of the 300 patients  receiving the PCR test, 264 had complete medical records and were compared to 771 who received usual care. We used a logistic regression model to identify whether  PCR guided care was associated with guideline consistent care, based on the appropriate use of oseltamivir and antibiotics. We also assessed whether PCR guided care decreased the likelihood of return visits within 2 weeks by patients. RESULTS: Logistic regression revealed that the odds of receiving guideline supported care did not significantly increase for patients who received PCR guided care (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.24; 95\% CI, 0.83-1.88). It significantly decreased the likelihood of an antibiotic prescription (aOR, 0.61;  95\% CI, 0.40-0.94), increased the likelihood of receiving oseltamivir (aOR, 1.57; 95\% CI, 1.09-2.28), and decreased the likelihood of return visit within 2 weeks (aOR, 0.19; 95\% CI, 0.04-0.81). CONCLUSIONS: The use of a rapid PCR test did not  significantly improve the likelihood of guideline consistent care. However, independent of test outcome, patients who received the test were more likely to receive an antiviral and less likely to receive an antibiotic or have a return visit within 2 weeks.},

  abstract = {Vaccination is an effective method to protect against infectious diseases. An important consideration in any vaccine formulation is the inoculum dose, i.e., amount of antigen or live attenuated pathogen that is used. Higher levels generally lead to better stimulation of the immune response but might cause more  severe side effects and allow for less population coverage in the presence of vaccine shortages. Determining the optimal amount of inoculum dose is an important component of rational vaccine design. A combination of mathematical models with experimental data can help determine the impact of the inoculum dose. We illustrate the concept of using data and models to inform inoculum dose determination for vaccines, wby fitting a mathematical model to data from influenza A virus (IAV) infection of mice and human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) infection of cotton rats at different inoculum doses. We use the model to map inoculum dose to the level of immune protection and morbidity and to explore how  such a framework might be used to determine an optimal inoculum dose. We show how a framework that combines mathematical models with experimental data can be used  to study the impact of inoculum dose on important outcomes such as immune protection and morbidity. Our findings illustrate that the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity can depend on the specific pathogen and that both protection and morbidity do not necessarily increase monotonically with increasing inoculum dose. Once vaccine design goals are specified with required levels of protection and acceptable levels of morbidity, our proposed framework can help in the rational design of vaccines and determination of the optimal amount of inoculum.},

  abstract = {Determining the duration of protective immunity requires quantifying the magnitude and rate of loss of antibodies to different virus and vaccine antigens. A key complication is heterogeneity in both the magnitude and decay rate of responses of different individuals to a given vaccine, as well as of a given individual to different vaccines. We analyzed longitudinal data on antibody titers in 45 individuals to characterize the extent of this heterogeneity and used models to determine how it affected the longevity of protective immunity to  measles, rubella, vaccinia, tetanus, and diphtheria. Our analysis showed that the magnitude of responses in different individuals varied between 12- and 200-fold (95\% coverage) depending on the antigen. Heterogeneity in the magnitude and decay rate contribute comparably to variation in the longevity of protective immunity between different individuals. We found that some individuals have, on average, slightly longer-lasting memory than others-on average, they have higher antibody  levels with slower decay rates. We identified different patterns for the loss of  protective levels of antibodies to different vaccine and virus antigens. Specifically, we found that for the first 25 to 50 years, virtually all individuals have protective antibody titers against diphtheria and tetanus, respectively, but about 10\% of the population subsequently lose protective immunity per decade. In contrast, at the outset, not all individuals had protective titers against measles, rubella, and vaccinia. However, these antibody titers wane much more slowly, with a loss of protective immunity in only 1\% to 3\% of the population per decade. Our results highlight the importance of long-term longitudinal studies for estimating the duration of protective immunity and suggest both how vaccines might be improved and how boosting schedules might be reevaluated.},

  abstract = {For most pathogens, vaccination reduces the spread of the infection and total number of cases; thus, public policy usually advocates maximizing vaccination coverage. We use simple mathematical models to explore how this may be different  for pathogens, such as influenza, which exhibit strain variation. Our models predict that the total number of seasonal influenza infections is minimized at an intermediate (rather than maximal) level of vaccination, and, somewhat counter-intuitively, further increasing the level of the vaccination coverage may lead to higher number of influenza infections and be detrimental to the public interest. This arises due to the combined effects of: competition between multiple co-circulating strains; limited breadth of protection afforded by the vaccine; and short-term strain-transcending immunity following natural infection. The study highlights the need for better quantification of the components of vaccine efficacy and longevity of strain-transcending cross-immunity in order to  generate nuanced recommendations for influenza vaccine coverage levels.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis is a leading cause of global childhood mortality; however, interventions to detect undiagnosed tuberculosis in children are underused. Child contact tracing has been widely recommended but poorly implemented in resource-constrained settings. WHO has proposed a pragmatic screening approach for managing child contacts. We assessed the effectiveness of  this screening approach and alternative symptom-based algorithms in identifying secondary tuberculosis in a prospectively followed cohort of Ugandan child contacts. METHODS: We identified index patients aged at least 18 years with microbiologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis at Old Mulago Hospital (Kampala, Uganda) between Oct 1, 1995, and Dec 31, 2008. Households of index patients were visited by fieldworkers within 2 weeks of diagnosis. Coprevalent and incident tuberculosis were assessed in household contacts through clinical, radiographical, and microbiological examinations for 2 years. Disease rates were  compared among children younger than 16 years with and without symptoms included  in the WHO pragmatic guideline (presence of haemoptysis, fever, chronic cough, weight loss, night sweats, and poor appetite). Symptoms could be of any duration, except cough ({\textgreater}21 days) and fever ({\textgreater}14 days). A modified WHO decision-tree designed to detect high-risk asymptomatic child contacts was also assessed, in which all asymptomatic contacts were classified as high risk (children younger than 3 years or immunocompromised [HIV-infected]) or low risk (aged 3 years or older and immunocompetent [HIV-negative]). We also assessed a more restrictive algorithm (ie, assessing only children with presence of chronic cough and one other tuberculosis-related symptom). FINDINGS: Of 1718 household child contacts,  126 (7\%) had coprevalent tuberculosis and 24 (1\%) developed incident tuberculosis, diagnosed over the 2-year study period. Of these 150 cases of tuberculosis, 95 (63\%) were microbiologically confirmed with a positive sputum culture. Using the WHO approach, 364 (21\%) of 1718 child contacts had at least one tuberculosis-related symptom and 85 (23\%) were identified as having coprevalent tuberculosis, 67\% of all coprevalent cases detected (diagnostic odds  ratio 9.8, 95\% CI 6.8-14.5; p{\textless}0.0001). 1354 (79\%) of 1718 child contacts had no symptoms, of whom 41 (3\%) had coprevalent tuberculosis. The WHO approach was effective in contacts younger than 5 years: 70 (33\%) of 211 symptomatic contacts  had coprevalent disease compared with 23 (6\%) of 367 asymptomatic contacts (p{\textless}0.0001). This approach was also effective in contacts aged 5 years and older:  15 (10\%) of 153 symptomatic contacts had coprevalent disease compared with 18 (2\%) of 987 asymptomatic contacts (p{\textless}0.0001). More coprevalent disease was detected in child contacts recommended for screening when the study population was restricted by HIV-serostatus (11 [48\%] of 23 symptomatic HIV-seropositive child contacts vs two [7\%] of 31 asymptomatic HIV-seropositive child contacts) or to only culture-confirmed cases (47 [13\%] culture confirmed cases of 364 symptomatic child contacts vs 29 [2\%] culture confirmed cases of 1354 asymptomatic child contacts). In the modified algorithm, high-risk asymptomatic child contacts were at increased risk for coprevalent disease versus low-risk asymptomatic contacts (14 [6\%] of 224 vs 27 [2\%] of 1130; p=0.0021). The presence of tuberculosis infection did not predict incident disease in either symptomatic  or asymptomatic child contacts: in symptomatic contacts, eight (5\%) of 169 infected contacts and six (5\%) of 111 uninfected contacts developed incident tuberculosis (p=0.80). Among asymptomatic contacts, incident tuberculosis occurred in six ({\textless}1\%) of 795 contacts infected at baseline versus four ({\textless}1\%) of 518 contacts uninfected at baseline, respectively (p=1.00). INTERPRETATION: WHO's pragmatic, symptom-based algorithm was an effective case-finding tool, especially in children younger than 5 years. A modified decision-tree identified 6\% of asymptomatic child contacts at high risk for subclinical disease. Increasing the  feasibility of child-contact tracing using these approaches should be encouraged  to decrease tuberculosis-related paediatric mortality in high-burden settings, but this should be partnered with increasing access to microbiological point-of-care testing.

However, the mechanisms underpinning such HLA-mediated effects on self-tolerance remain unclear. Here we  investigate the molecular mechanism of Goodpasture disease, an HLA-linked autoimmune renal disorder characterized by an immunodominant CD4(+) T-cell self-epitope derived from the alpha3 chain of type IV collagen (alpha3135-145). While HLA-DR15 confers a markedly increased disease risk, the protective HLA-DR1  allele is dominantly protective in trans with HLA-DR15 (ref. 2). We show that autoreactive alpha3135-145-specific T cells expand in patients with Goodpasture disease and, in alpha3135-145-immunized HLA-DR15 transgenic mice, alpha3135-145-specific T cells infiltrate the kidney and mice develop Goodpasture disease. HLA-DR15 and HLA-DR1 exhibit distinct peptide repertoires and binding preferences and present the alpha3135-145 epitope in different binding registers.},

To date, no pandemic emergence of a new influenza strain has been preceded by detection of a closely related precursor in an animal or human. Nonetheless, influenza surveillance efforts are expanding, prompting a need for tools to assess the pandemic risk posed by a detected virus. The goal would be to use genetic sequence and/or biological assays of viral traits to identify those non-human influenza viruses with the greatest risk of evolving into pandemic threats, and/or to understand drivers of such evolution, to prioritize pandemic prevention or response measures. We describe such efforts, identify progress and  ongoing challenges, and discuss three specific traits of influenza viruses (hemagglutinin receptor binding specificity, hemagglutinin pH of activation, and  polymerase complex efficiency) that contribute to pandemic risk.},

Norovirus vaccine development has progressed in recent years, but critical questions remain regarding which age groups should be vaccinated to maximize population impact. METHODS: We developed  a deterministic, age-structured compartmental model of norovirus transmission and immunity in the U.S. POPULATION: The model was fit to age-specific monthly U.S. hospitalizations between 1996 and 2007. We simulated mass immunization of both pediatric and elderly populations assuming realistic coverages of 90\% and 65\%, respectively. We considered two mechanism of vaccine action, resulting in lower vaccine efficacy (lVE) between 22\% and 43\% and higher VE (hVE) of 50\%. RESULTS: Pediatric vaccination was predicted to avert 33\% (95\% CI: 27\%, 40\%) and 60\% (95\%  CI: 49\%, 71\%) of norovirus episodes among children under five years for lVE and hVE, respectively. Vaccinating the elderly averted 17\% (95\% CI: 12\%, 20\%) and 38\% (95\% CI: 34\%, 42\%) of cases in 65+ year olds for lVE and hVE, respectively. At a  population level, pediatric vaccination was predicted to avert 18-21 times more cases and twice as many deaths per vaccinee compared to elderly vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: The potential benefits are likely greater for a pediatric program, both via direct protection of vaccinated children and indirect protection of unvaccinated individuals, including adults and the elderly. These findings argue  for a clinical development plan that will deliver a vaccine with a safety and efficacy profile suitable for use in children.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: The post-2015 End TB Strategy sets global targets of reducing tuberculosis incidence by 50\% and mortality by 75\% by 2025. We aimed to assess resource requirements and cost-effectiveness of strategies to achieve these targets in China, India, and South Africa. METHODS: We examined intervention scenarios developed in consultation with country stakeholders, which scaled up existing interventions to high but feasible coverage by 2025. Nine independent modelling groups collaborated to estimate policy outcomes, and we estimated the cost of each scenario by synthesising service use estimates, empirical cost data, and expert opinion on implementation strategies. We estimated health effects (ie, disability-adjusted life-years averted) and resource implications for 2016-35, including patient-incurred costs. To assess resource requirements and cost-effectiveness, we compared scenarios with a base case representing continued current practice. FINDINGS: Incremental tuberculosis service costs differed by scenario and country, and in some cases they more than doubled existing funding needs. In general, expansion of tuberculosis services substantially reduced patient-incurred costs and, in India and China, produced net cost savings for most interventions under a societal perspective. In all three countries, expansion of access to care produced substantial health gains. Compared with current practice and conventional cost-effectiveness thresholds, most intervention approaches seemed highly cost-effective. INTERPRETATION: Expansion of tuberculosis services seems cost-effective for high-burden countries and could generate substantial health and economic benefits for patients, although substantial new funding would be required. Further work to determine the optimal  intervention mix for each country is necessary. FUNDING: Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: The post-2015 End TB Strategy proposes targets of 50\% reduction in tuberculosis incidence and 75\% reduction in mortality from tuberculosis by 2025.  We aimed to assess whether these targets are feasible in three high-burden countries with contrasting epidemiology and previous programmatic achievements. METHODS: 11 independently developed mathematical models of tuberculosis transmission projected the epidemiological impact of currently available tuberculosis interventions for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in China, India, and South Africa. Models were calibrated with data on tuberculosis incidence and mortality in 2012. Representatives from national tuberculosis programmes and the advocacy community provided distinct country-specific intervention scenarios, which included screening for symptoms, active case finding, and preventive therapy. FINDINGS: Aggressive scale-up of any single intervention scenario could not achieve the post-2015 End TB Strategy targets in  any country. However, the models projected that, in the South Africa national tuberculosis programme scenario, a combination of continuous isoniazid preventive therapy for individuals on antiretroviral therapy, expanded facility-based screening for symptoms of tuberculosis at health centres, and improved tuberculosis care could achieve a 55\% reduction in incidence (range 31-62\%) and a 72\% reduction in mortality (range 64-82\%) compared with 2015 levels. For India, and particularly for China, full scale-up of all interventions in tuberculosis-programme performance fell short of the 2025 targets, despite preventing a cumulative 3.4 million cases. The advocacy scenarios illustrated the high impact of detecting and treating latent tuberculosis. INTERPRETATION: Major  reductions in tuberculosis burden seem possible with current interventions. However, additional interventions, adapted to country-specific tuberculosis epidemiology and health systems, are needed to reach the post-2015 End TB Strategy targets at country level.

  abstract = {The current influenza vaccine provides narrow protection against the strains included in the vaccine, and needs to be reformulated every few years in response to the constantly evolving new strains. Novel approaches are directed toward developing vaccines that provide broader protection by targeting B and T cell epitopes that are conserved between different strains of the virus. In this paper, we focus on developing mathematical models to explore the CD8 T cell responses to influenza, how they can be boosted, and the conditions under which they contribute to protection. Our models suggest that the interplay between spatial heterogeneity (with the virus infecting the respiratory tract and the immune response being generated in the secondary lymphoid organs) and T cell differentiation (with proliferation occurring in the lymphoid organs giving rise  to a subpopulation of resident T cells in the respiratory tract) is the key to understand the dynamics of protection afforded by the CD8 T cell response to influenza. Our results suggest that the time lag for the generation of resident T cells in the respiratory tract and their rate of decay following infection are the key factors that limit the efficacy of CD8 T cell responses. The models predict that an increase in the level of central memory T cells leads to a gradual decrease in the viral load, and, in contrast, there is a sharper protection threshold for the relationship between the size of the population of resident T cells and protection. The models also suggest that repeated natural influenza infections cause the number of central memory CD8 T cells and the peak  number of resident memory CD8 T cells to reach their plateaus, and while the former is maintained, the latter decays with time since the most recent infection.},

  abstract = {The World Health Organization identifies influenza as a major public health problem. While the strains commonly circulating in humans usually do not cause severe pathogenicity in healthy adults, some strains that have infected humans, such as H5N1, can cause high morbidity and mortality. Based on the severity of the disease, influenza viruses are sometimes categorized as either being highly pathogenic (HP) or having low pathogenicity (LP). The reasons why some strains are LP and others HP are not fully understood. While there are likely multiple mechanisms of interaction between the virus and the immune response that determine LP versus HP outcomes, we focus here on one component, namely macrophages (MP). There is some evidence that MP may both help fight the infection and become productively infected with HP influenza viruses. We developed mathematical models for influenza infections which explicitly included  the dynamics and action of MP. We fit these models to viral load and macrophage count data from experimental infections of mice with LP and HP strains. Our results suggest that MP may not only help fight an influenza infection but may contribute to virus production in infections with HP viruses. We also explored the impact of combination therapies with antivirals and anti-inflammatory drugs on HP infections. Our study suggests a possible mechanism of MP in determining HP versus LP outcomes, and how different interventions might affect infection dynamics.},

  abstract = {In advanced age, decreased CD8(+) cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses to novel pathogens and cancer is paralleled by a decline in the number and function of naive CTL precursors (CTLp). Although the age-related fall in CD8(+) T-cell numbers is well established, neither the underlying mechanisms nor the extent of  variation for different epitope specificities have been defined. Furthermore, naive CD8(+) T cells expressing high levels of CD44 accumulate with age, but it is unknown whether this accumulation reflects their preferential survival or an age-dependent driver of CD8(+) T-cell proliferation. Here, we track the number and phenotype of four influenza A virus (IAV)-specific CTLp populations in naive  C57BL/6 (B6) mice during aging, and compare T-cell receptor (TCR) clonal diversity for the CD44hi and CD44lo subsets of one such population. We show differential onset of decline for several IAV-specific CD8(+) T-cell populations  with advanced age that parallel age-associated changes in the B6 immunodominance  hierarchy, suggestive of distinct impacts of aging on different epitope-specific  populations. Despite finding no evidence of clonal expansions in an aged, epitope-specific TCR repertoire, nonrandom alterations in TCR usage were observed, along with elevated CD5 and CD8 coreceptor expression. Collectively, these data demonstrate that naive CD8(+) T cells expressing markers of heightened self-recognition are selectively retained, but not clonally expanded, during aging.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delay in tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis adversely affects patients' outcomes and prolongs transmission in the community. The influence of social contacts on steps taken by active pulmonary TB patients to seek a diagnosis has not been well examined. METHODS: A retrospective study design was use to enroll TB patients on treatment for 3 months or less and aged {\textgreater}/=18 years from 3 public  clinics in Kampala, Uganda, from March to July 2014. Social network analysis was  used to collect information about social contacts and health providers visited by patients to measure the number of steps and time between onset of symptoms and final diagnosis of TB. RESULTS: Of 294 TB patients, 58 \% were male and median age was 30 (IQR: 24-38) years. The median number of steps was 4 (IQR: 3, 7) corresponding to 70 (IQR: 28,140) days to diagnosis. New patients had more steps  and time to diagnosis compared retreatment patients (5 vs. 3, P {\textless} 0.0001; 84 vs.  46 days P {\textless} 0.0001). Fifty-eight percent of patients first contacted persons in their social network. The first step to initiate seeking care accounted for 41 \%  of the patients' time to diagnosis while visits to non-TB providers and TB providers (without a TB diagnosis) accounted for 34 \% and 11 \% respectively. New  TB patients vs. retreatment (HR: 0.66, 95 \% CI; 1.11, 1.99), those who first contacted a non-TB health provider vs. contacting social network (HR: 0.72 95 \% CI; 0.55, 0.95) and HIV seronegative vs. seropositive patients (HR: 0.70, 95 \% CI; 0.53, 0.92) had a significantly lower likelihood of a timely final diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: There were four degrees of separation between the onset of symptoms  in a TB patient and a final diagnosis. Both social and provider networks of patients influenced the diagnostic pathways. Most delays occurred in the first step which represents decisions to seek help, and through interactions with non-TB health providers. TB control programs should strengthen education and active screening in the community and in health care settings to ensure timely diagnosis of TB.},

Here, we provide a brief discussion of both models and data that have attempted to provide quantitative mappings from within-host infection dynamics to transmission fitness. We present a conceptual framework and provide examples of studies that have taken first steps towards development of a quantitative framework that scales from within-host infections to population-level fitness of different pathogens. We hope to illustrate some general themes, summarize some of the recent advances and-maybe most importantly-discuss gaps in our ability to bridge these scales, and to stimulate  future research on this important topic.},

  abstract = {CD8(+) T cells directed against conserved viral regions elicit broad immunity against distinct influenza viruses, promote rapid virus elimination and enhanced  host recovery. The influenza neuraminidase inhibitor, oseltamivir, is prescribed  for therapy and prophylaxis, although it remains unclear how the drug impacts disease severity and establishment of effector and memory CD8(+) T cell immunity. We dissected the effects of oseltamivir on viral replication, inflammation, acute CD8(+) T cell responses and the establishment of immunological CD8(+) T cell memory. In mice, ferrets and humans, the effect of osteltamivir on viral titre was relatively modest. However, prophylactic oseltamivir treatment in mice markedly reduced morbidity, innate responses, inflammation and, ultimately, the magnitude of effector CD8(+) T cell responses. Importantly, functional memory CD8(+) T cells established during the drug-reduced effector phase were capable of mounting robust recall responses. Moreover, influenza-specific memory CD4(+) T cells could be also recalled after the secondary challenge, while the antibody levels were unaffected. This provides evidence that long-term memory T cells can  be generated during an oseltamivir-interrupted infection. The anti-inflammatory effect of oseltamivir was verified in H1N1-infected patients. Thus, in the case of an unpredicted influenza pandemic, while prophylactic oseltamivir treatment can reduce disease severity, the capacity to generate memory CD8(+) T cells specific for the newly emerged virus is uncompromised. This could prove especially important for any new influenza pandemic which often occurs in separate waves.},

  abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease with a peculiar feature: Upon infection with the causative agent, Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (MTB), most hosts  enter a latent state during which no transmission of MTB to new hosts occurs. Only a fraction of latently infected hosts develop TB disease and can potentially infect new hosts. At first glance, this seems like a waste of transmission potential and therefore an evolutionary suboptimal strategy for MTB. It might be  that the human immune response keeps MTB in check in most hosts, thereby preventing it from achieving its evolutionary optimum. Another possible explanation is that long latency and progression to disease in only a fraction of hosts are evolutionary beneficial to MTB by allowing it to persist better in small host populations. Given that MTB has co-evolved with human hosts for millenia or longer, it likely encountered small host populations for a large share of its evolutionary history and had to evolve strategies of persistence. Here, we use a mathematical model to show that indeed, MTB persistence is optimal for an intermediate duration of latency and level of activation. The predicted optimal level of activation is above the observed value, suggesting that human co-evolution has lead to host immunity, which keeps MTB below its evolutionary optimum.},

  abstract  = {Trade-offs between different components of a pathogen's replication and transmission cycle are thought to be common. A number of studies have identified  trade-offs that emerge across scales, reflecting the tension between strategies that optimize within-host proliferation and large-scale population spread. Most of these studies are theoretical in nature, with direct experimental tests of such cross-scale trade-offs still rare. Here, we report an analysis of avian influenza A viruses across scales, focusing on the phenotype of temperature-dependent viral persistence. Taking advantage of a unique dataset that reports both environmental virus decay rates and strain-specific viral kinetics from duck challenge experiments, we show that the temperature-dependent  environmental decay rate of a strain does not impact within-host virus load. Hence, for this phenotype, the scales of within-host infection dynamics and between-host environmental persistence do not seem to interact: viral fitness may be optimized on each scale without cross-scale trade-offs. Instead, we confirm the existence of a temperature-dependent persistence trade-off on a single scale, with some strains favouring environmental persistence in water at low temperatures while others reduce sensitivity to increasing temperatures. We show  that this temperature-dependent trade-off is a robust phenomenon and does not depend on the details of data analysis. Our findings suggest that viruses might employ different environmental persistence strategies, which facilitates the coexistence of diverse strains in ecological niches. We conclude that a better understanding of the transmission and evolutionary dynamics of influenza A viruses probably requires empirical information regarding both within-host dynamics and environmental traits, integrated within a combined ecological and within-host framework.},

  abstract  = {Human CMV still remains problematic in immunocompromised patients, particularly after solid organ transplantation. CMV primary disease and reactivation greatly increase the risks associated with incidences of chronic allograft rejection and  decreased survival in transplant recipients. But whether this is due to direct viral effects, indirect viral effects including cross-reactive antiviral T cell immunopathology, or a combination of both remains undetermined. In this article,  we report the novel TCR signature of cross-reactive HLA-A*02:01 (A2) CMV (NLVPMVATV [NLV])-specific CD8(+) T cells recognizing a specific array of HLA-B27 alleles using technical advancements that combine both IFN-gamma secretion and multiplex nested RT-PCR for determining paired CDR3alpha/beta sequences from a single cell. This study represents the first evidence, to our knowledge, of the same A2-restricted cross-reactive NLV-specific TCR-alpha/beta signature (TRAV3TRAJ31\_TRBV12-4TRBJ1-1) in two genetically distinct individuals. Longitudinal posttransplant monitoring of a lung transplant recipient (A2, CMV seropositive) who received a HLA-B27 bilateral lung allograft showed a dynamic expansion of the cross-reactive NLV-specific TCR repertoire before CMV reactivation. After resolution of the active viral infection, the frequency of cross-reactive NLV-specific CD8(+) T cells reduced to previremia levels, thereby  demonstrating immune modulation of the T cell repertoire due to antigenic pressure. The dynamic changes in TCR repertoire, at a time when CMV reactivation  was subclinical, illustrates that prospective monitoring in susceptible patients  can reveal nuances in immune profiles that may be clinically relevant.},

The extent to  which this arises as a consequence of stochastic clonal expansion vs. active selection of particular clones remains unclear. Using a parallel adoptive transfer protocol in combination with single cell analysis to define the complementarity determining region (CDR) 3alpha and CDR3beta regions of individual T-cell receptor (TCR) heterodimers, we characterized the antigen-driven recall of the same memory CTL population in three individual recipients. This high-resolution analysis showed reproducible enrichment (or diminution) of particular TCR clonotypes across all challenged animals. These changes in clonal composition were TCRalpha- and beta chain-dependent and were directly related to the avidity of the TCR for the virus-derived peptide (p) + major histocompatibility complex class I molecule. Despite this shift in clonotype representation indicative of differential selection, there was no evidence of overall repertoire narrowing, suggesting a strategy to optimize CTL responses while safeguarding TCR diversity.},

  abstract  = {Inoculum dose, i.e. the number of pathogens at the beginning of an infection, often affects key aspects of pathogen and immune response dynamics. These in turn determine clinically relevant outcomes, such as morbidity and mortality. Despite  the general recognition that inoculum dose is an important component of infection outcomes, we currently do not understand its impact in much detail. This study is intended to start filling this knowledge gap by analyzing inoculum dependent patterns of viral load dynamics in acute infections. Using experimental data for  adenovirus and infectious bronchitis virus infections as examples, we demonstrate inoculum dose dependent patterns of virus dynamics. We analyze the data with the  help of mathematical models to investigate what mechanisms can reproduce the patterns observed in experimental data. We find that models including components  of both the innate and adaptive immune response are needed to reproduce the patterns found in the data. We further analyze which types of innate or adaptive  immune response models agree with observed data. One interesting finding is that  only models for the adaptive immune response that contain growth terms partially  independent of viral load can properly reproduce observed patterns. This agrees with the idea that an antigen-independent, programmed response is part of the adaptive response. Our analysis provides useful insights into the types of model  structures that are required to properly reproduce observed virus dynamics for varying inoculum doses. We suggest that such models should be taken as basis for  future models of acute viral infections.},

  abstract = {Successful replication within an infected host and successful transmission between hosts are key to the continued spread of most pathogens. Competing selection pressures exerted at these different scales can lead to evolutionary trade-offs between the determinants of fitness within and between hosts. Here, we examine such a trade-off in the context of influenza A viruses and the differential pressures exerted by temperature-dependent virus persistence. For a  panel of avian influenza A virus strains, we find evidence for a trade-off between the persistence at high versus low temperatures. Combining a within-host  model of influenza infection dynamics with a between-host transmission model, we  study how such a trade-off affects virus fitness on the host population level. We show that conclusions regarding overall fitness are affected by the type of link  assumed between the within- and between-host levels and the main route of transmission (direct or environmental). The relative importance of virulence and  immune response mediated virus clearance are also found to influence the fitness  impacts of virus persistence at low versus high temperatures. Based on our results, we predict that if transmission occurs mainly directly and scales linearly with virus load, and virulence or immune responses are negligible, the evolutionary pressure for influenza viruses to evolve toward good persistence at  high within-host temperatures dominates. For all other scenarios, influenza viruses with good environmental persistence at low temperatures seem to be favored.},

Any control measures above that optimal level will lead to an outcome that may be as  sub-optimal as that achieved by an intervention that is too weak. We studied this scenario in more detail. METHOD: An age-stratified ordinary-differential-equation model was constructed to study infectious disease outbreaks and control in a population made up of two groups, adults and children. The model was parameterized using influenza as an example. This model was used to simulate two  consecutive outbreaks of the same infectious disease, with an intervention applied only during the first outbreak, and to study how cumulative attack rates  were influenced by population composition, strength of inter-group transmission,  and different ways of triggering and implementing the interventions. We assumed that recovered individuals are fully immune and the intervention does not confer  immunity. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: The optimal intervention depended on coupling between the two population sub-groups, the length, strength and timing of the intervention, and the population composition. Population heterogeneity affected intervention strategies only for very low cross-transmission between groups. At more realistic values, coupling between the groups led to synchronization of outbreaks and therefore intervention strategies that were optimal in reducing the attack rates for each subgroup and the population overall coincided. For a sustained intervention of low efficacy, early intervention was found to be best,  while at high efficacies, a delayed start was better. For short interventions, a  delayed start was always advantageous, independent of the intervention efficacy.  For most scenarios, starting the intervention after a certain cumulative proportion of children were infected seemed more robust in achieving close to optimal outcomes compared to a strategy that used a specified duration after an outbreak's beginning as the trigger.},

This report reviews published NoV outbreak  reports to quantify hospitalization and mortality rates and assess their relationship with outbreak setting, transmission route, and strain. METHODS: Using a string of terms related to "norovirus" and "outbreak," we 2435 nonduplicate articles identified in PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Knowledge published between January 1993 and June 2011. Inclusion criteria included outbreaks with a minimum of 2 ill persons with a common exposure and at least 1 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction-confirmed case of NoV disease. Univariate analyses were performed, and multivariable models were fitted to estimate the independent effect of each factor. RESULTS: We analyzed 843 NoV outbreaks reported in 233 published articles from 45 countries. Based upon 71724  illnesses, 501 hospitalizations, and 45 deaths, overall hospitalization and mortality rates were 0.54\% and 0.06\%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, genogroup 2 genotype 4 (GII.4) NoV strains were associated with higher hospitalization (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 9.4; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 6.1-14.4; P{\textless} .001) and mortality rates (IRR, 3.1; 95\% CI, 1.3-7.6; P = .01). Deaths were much more likely to occur in outbreaks occurring in healthcare facilities (IRR, 60; 95\% CI, 6-109; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: Our review suggests that hospitalizations and deaths were more likely in outbreaks associated with GII.4 viruses, independent of other factors, and underscores the importance of developing vaccines against GII.4 viruses to prevent severe disease outcomes.},

Preferential selection for particular clonotypes was evident for the high-avidity D(b)PA(224)-specific set but not for any of the  other subsets examined.

Both during seasonal and pandemic influenza outbreaks, morbidity and  mortality due to secondary bacterial infections can be substantial. With the help of a mathematical model, we investigate the potential impact of such bacterial infections during an influenza pandemic, and we analyze how antiviral and antibacterial treatment or prophylaxis affect morbidity and mortality. We consider different scenarios for the spread of bacteria, the emergence of antiviral resistance, and different levels of severity for influenza infections (1918-like and 2009-like). We find that while antibacterial intervention strategies are unlikely to play an important role in reducing the overall number  of cases, such interventions can lead to a significant reduction in mortality and in the number of bacterial infections. Antibacterial interventions become even more important if one considers the--very likely--scenario that during a pandemic outbreak, influenza strains resistant to antivirals emerge. Overall, our study suggests that pandemic preparedness plans should consider intervention strategies based on antibacterial treatment or prophylaxis through drugs or vaccines as part of the overall control strategy. A major caveat for our results is the lack of data that would allow precise estimation of many of the model parameters. As our  results show, this leads to very large uncertainty in model outcomes. As we discuss, precise assessment of the impact of antibacterial strategies during an influenza pandemic will require the collection of further data to better estimate key parameters, especially those related to the bacterial infections and the impact of antibacterial intervention strategies.},

Less clear is how population size influences the level of fitness an asexual population can attain. Here, we simulate the evolution of bacteria in repeated serial passage experiments to explore how features such as fitness landscape ruggedness, the size of the mutational target under selection, and the mutation supply rate, interact to affect the evolution of microbial populations of different sizes. RESULTS: We find that if the fitness landscape has many local peaks, there can be a trade-off between the rate of adaptation and the potential  to reach high fitness peaks. This result derives from the fact that whereas large populations evolve mostly deterministically and often become trapped on local fitness peaks, smaller populations can follow more stochastic evolutionary paths  and thus locate higher fitness peaks. We also find that the target size of adaptation and the mutation rate interact with population size to influence the trade-off between rate of adaptation and final fitness. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the optimal population size for adaptation depends on the details of the environment and on the importance of either the ability to evolve rapidly  or to reach high fitness levels.},

  abstract = {For many bacterial infections, drug resistant mutants are likely present by the time antibiotic treatment starts. Nevertheless, such infections are often successfully cleared. It is commonly assumed that this is due to the combined action of drug and immune response, the latter facilitating clearance of the resistant population. However, most studies of drug resistance emergence during antibiotic treatment focus almost exclusively on the dynamics of bacteria and the drug and neglect the contribution of immune defenses. Here, we develop and analyze several mathematical models that explicitly include an immune response. We consider different types of immune responses and investigate how each impacts  the emergence of resistance. We show that an immune response that retains its strength despite a strong drug-induced decline of bacteria numbers considerably reduces the emergence of resistance, narrows the mutant selection window, and mitigates the effects of non-adherence to treatment. Additionally, we show that compared to an immune response that kills bacteria at a constant rate, one that trades reduced killing at high bacterial load for increased killing at low bacterial load is sometimes preferable. We discuss the predictions and hypotheses derived from this study and how they can be tested experimentally.},

  abstract = {Antiviral drugs, most notably the neuraminidase inhibitors, are an important component of control strategies aimed to prevent or limit any future influenza pandemic. The potential large-scale use of antiviral drugs brings with it the danger of drug resistance evolution. A number of recent studies have shown that the emergence of drug-resistant influenza could undermine the usefulness of antiviral drugs for the control of an epidemic or pandemic outbreak. While these  studies have provided important insights, the inherently stochastic nature of resistance generation and spread, as well as the potential for ongoing evolution  of the resistant strain have not been fully addressed. Here, we study a stochastic model of drug resistance emergence and consecutive evolution of the resistant strain in response to antiviral control during an influenza pandemic. We find that taking into consideration the ongoing evolution of the resistant strain does not increase the probability of resistance emergence; however, it increases the total number of infecteds if a resistant outbreak occurs. Our study further shows that taking stochasticity into account leads to results that can differ from deterministic models. Specifically, we find that rapid and strong control cannot only contain a drug sensitive outbreak, it can also prevent a resistant outbreak from occurring. We find that the best control strategy is early intervention heavily based on prophylaxis at a level that leads to outbreak containment. If containment is not possible, mitigation works best at intermediate levels of antiviral control. Finally, we show that the results are not very sensitive to the way resistance generation is modeled.},

In experimental studies, this is often the only way fitness can be increased. In natural settings, however, fitness can also be improved by increasing the ability of the  microbe to transmit from one host to the next. For many pathogens, transmission includes a phase outside the host during which they need to survive before the chance of reinfecting a new host occurs. In such a situation, a reduced death rate during this phase will lead to improved fitness. Here, we compute the fixation probability of mutants that better survive the transmission bottleneck during the evolution of microbial populations. We derive analytical results that  show that transmission mutants are often likely to occur and that their importance relative to growth mutants increases as the population decline during  the transmission phase increases. We confirm our theoretical results with numerical simulations and suggest specific experiments that can be done to test our predictions.},

  abstract = {Communication between cells is crucial for immune responses. An important means of communication during viral infections is the presentation of viral antigen on  the surface of an infected cell. Recently, it has been shown that antigen can be  shared between infected and uninfected cells through gap junctions, connexin-based channels, that allow the transport of small molecules. The uninfected cell receiving antigen can present it on its surface. Cells presenting viral antigen are detected and killed by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The killing of  uninfected cells can lead to increased immunopathology. However, the immune response might also profit from killing those uninfected bystander cells. One benefit might be the removal of future 'virus factories'. Another benefit might be through the creation of 'firebreaks', areas void of target cells, which increase the diffusion time of free virions, making their clearance more likely.  Here, we use theoretical models and simulations to explore how the mechanism of gap junction-mediated antigen transport (GMAT) affects the dynamics of the virus  and immune response. We show that under the assumption of a well-mixed system, GMAT leads to increased immunopathology, which always outweighs the benefit of reduced virus production due to the removal of future virus factories. By contrast, a spatially explicit model leads to quite different results. Here we find that the firebreak mechanism reduces both viral load and immunopathology. Our study thus shows the potential benefits of GMAT and illustrates how spatial effects may be crucial for the quantitative understanding of infection dynamics and immune responses.},

Several recent studies have investigated immunodominance of H-2D(b)-restricted CD8(+) T cells specific for the nucleoprotein NP366 and acid polymerase PA224 epitopes during influenza A virus infection of C57BL/6 mice. CD8(+) T cells specific for these two epitopes are codominant during primary infection; NP366 dominates during secondary infection. While a number of explanations for this observation have been proposed, none of them can fully account for all the observed data. In this article, we use a simple mathematical model to explain the seemingly inconsistent data. We show that the dynamic interactions between CD8(+) T cells and antigen presentation lead to a situation where CD8(+) T cells are limiting during the initial response whereas antigen is limiting in the secondary response. This "numbers game" between antigen and CD8(+) T cells can reproduce the observed immunodominance of the NP336- and PA224-specific CD8(+) T cells, thereby explaining the reported experimental data.},

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we test this widely held conjecture using both simulations and experiments with small and large bacterial  populations evolving in either a simple or a complex nutrient environment. Consistent with expectations, we find that small populations are adaptively constrained in the simple environment; however, in the complex environment small  populations not only follow more heterogeneous adaptive trajectories, but can also attain higher fitness than the large populations. Large populations are constrained to near deterministic fixation of rare large-benefit mutations. While such determinism speeds adaptation on the smooth adaptive landscape represented by the simple environment, it can limit the ability of large populations from effectively exploring the underlying topography of rugged adaptive landscapes characterized by complex environments. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that adaptive constraints often faced by small populations can be circumvented during  evolution on rugged adaptive landscapes.},

  abstract = {Neuraminidase Inhibitors (NI) are currently the most effective drugs against influenza. Recent cases of NI resistance are a cause for concern. To assess the danger of NI resistance, a number of studies have reported the fraction of treated patients from which resistant strains could be isolated. Unfortunately, those results strongly depend on the details of the experimental protocol. Additionally, knowing the fraction of patients harboring resistance is not too useful by itself. Instead, we want to know how likely it is that an infected patient can generate a resistant infection in a secondary host, and how likely it is that the resistant strain subsequently spreads. While estimates for these parameters can often be obtained from epidemiological data, such data is lacking  for NI resistance in influenza. Here, we use an approach that does not rely on epidemiological data. Instead, we combine data from influenza infections of human volunteers with a mathematical framework that allows estimation of the parameters that govern the initial generation and subsequent spread of resistance. We show how these parameters are influenced by changes in drug efficacy, timing of treatment, fitness of the resistant strain, and details of virus and immune system dynamics. Our study provides estimates for parameters that can be directly used in mathematical and computational models to study how NI usage might lead to the emergence and spread of resistance in the population. We find that the initial generation of resistant cases is most likely lower than the fraction of resistant cases reported. However, we also show that the results depend strongly  on the details of the within-host dynamics of influenza infections, and most importantly, the role the immune system plays. Better knowledge of the quantitative dynamics of the immune response during influenza infections will be  crucial to further improve the results.},

The aim of this paper is to extend the generalized stability analysis, in the context of spatially extended systems, by examining the role of the nonlinear terms in the destabilization process. The critical noise level leading to destabilization is often found to scale as a power of the magnitude of transient amplification. In what follows we show that the power law exponent sensitively depends on the type  of nonlinear terms and their potential for generating self-sustaining noise amplification cycles (bootstrapping). We find, however, that the exponents are not universal and also depend on the more subtle details of the transient dynamics. We also show that the basin of attraction of a spatially uniform state  is bounded by the stable manifold(s) of nearby saddle(s) which play a major role  in the transition.},
