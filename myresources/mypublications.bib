  abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic prompted universities across the United States to close campuses in Spring 2020. Universities are deliberating whether, when, and how they should resume in-person instruction in Fall 2020. In this essay, we discuss some practical considerations for the use of 2 potentially useful control strategies based on testing: (1) severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing followed by case-patient isolation and quarantine of close contacts, and (2) serological testing followed by an ``immune shield'' approach, that is, low social distancing requirements for seropositive persons. The isolation of case-patients and quarantine of close contacts may be especially challenging, and perhaps prohibitively difficult, on many university campuses. The ``immune shield'' strategy might be hobbled by a low positive predictive value of the tests used in populations with low seroprevalence. Both strategies carry logistical, ethical, and financial implications. The main nonpharmaceutical interventions will remain methods based on social distancing (eg, capping class size) and personal protective behaviors (eg, universal facemask wearing in public space) until vaccines become available, or unless the issues discussed herein can be resolved in such a way that using mass testing as main control strategies becomes viable.},

  abstract = {Vaccination is the most effective method to combat influenza. Vaccine effectiveness is influenced by the antigenic distance between the vaccine strain and the actual circulating virus. Amino acid sequence based methods of quantifying the antigenic distance were designed to predict influenza vaccine effectiveness in humans. The use of these antigenic distance measures has been proposed as an additive method for seasonal vaccine selection. In this report, several antigenic distance measures were evaluated as predictors of hemagglutination inhibition titer differences and clinical outcomes following influenza vaccination or infection in mice or ferrets. The antigenic distance measures described the increasing trend in the change of HAI titer, lung viral titer and percent weight loss in mice and ferrets. However, the variability of outcome variables produced wide prediction intervals for any given antigenic distance value. The amino acid substitution based antigenic distance measures were no better predictors of viral load and weight loss than HAI titer differences, the current predictive measure of immunological correlate of protection for clinical signs after challenge.},

  abstract = {Norovirus is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis outbreaks in the United States. We estimated the basic (R0) and effective (Re) reproduction numbers for 7,094 norovirus outbreaks reported to the National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS) during 2009\textendash 2017 and used regression models to assess whether transmission varied by outbreak setting. The median R0 was 2.75 (interquartile range [IQR] 2.38\textendash 3.65), and median Re was 1.29 (IQR 1.12\textendash 1.74). Long-term care and assisted living facilities had an R0~of~3.35 (95\% CI 3.26\textendash 3.45), but R0 did not differ substantially for outbreaks in other settings, except for outbreaks in schools, colleges, and universities, which had an R0~of 2.92 (95\% CI 2.82\textendash 3.03). Seasonally, R0 was lowest (3.11 [95\% CI 2.97\textendash 3.25]) in summer and peaked in fall and winter. Overall, we saw little variability in transmission across different outbreaks settings in the United States.},
