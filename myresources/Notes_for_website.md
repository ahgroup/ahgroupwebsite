# Website structure
* All content should be in /content folder and subfolders
* /assets contains files for customized formatting, and the site logo
* /config contains toml configuration files, edit as needed
* /data and /i18n contain copies of files in the same folders of /academic which overwrite those. Needed for custom publication types
* /myresources contains this file and other files I might need for writing the page.
* /public is the folder created by hugo for deployment. Don't edit, copy to website server. This folder is not synced over to github!
* /resources folder seems to be generated by hugo, leave alone
* /static contains my images and files that are linked from other sites.
* /themes folder should contain the /academic theme/folder with all subfolders. Update that to new version as needed.

# Content folder
This folder contains allmost all written content. Subfolders are:
* /authors contains every group member. (paper co-authors that are not group members don't need to be included).
* /home specifies the widgets shown on the main page.
* /opportunities is the content for the page of that name. split between an index file for the overall page and the actual widget containing the content.
* /people contains meta-information for the people section. all actual information is drawn from the /authors folder.
* /post contains new posts. each post should be a subfolder.
* /project contains all projects as subfolders.
* /projects contains the meta-information for the projects, the actual information is drawn from the /project folder.
* /publication contains all papers. generated as described below.
* /resources is the content for the page of that name

# General notes
I'm not using regular pages at this point. Instead, stand-alone pages (e.g. resources) are done using the 'blank' widget. That makes things consistent for the academic theme (though likely won't port easily to different themes).

# To add new group members
* Copy an existing entry in the authors sub-folder, modify as needed

# To add new blog posts
* Use RStudio addin, or easier, copy/paste/modify an existing entry 

# To add new projects
* copy/paste/modify an existing entry 

# To add new publications 
* add entry to 'mynewbibs.bib' file. Include abstract. Can do that by pulling website article from zotero or through myncbi.
* Run the academic tool for publications: https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/managing-content/
* Make sure folder is not the actual website since we don't want existing pubs overwritten, otherwise they'll loose their special formatting.
* Copy the new entries into the main /publication folder
* Add a pdf to each publication folder with the same name as the folder for that publication
* adjust each index.md to set custom publication type 
* My custom publication types are in data/publication_types.toml
publications.md in content/home describes the different types
To adjust labels/categories for publications, edit a layout file, then adjust numbers in publications:
