# Website structure
* All content should be in /content folder and subfolders
* /config contains toml configuration files, edit as needed
* /data and /i18n contain copies of files in the same folders of /academic which overwrite those. Needed for custom publication types
* /myresources contains this file and other files I might need for writing the page.
* /public is the folder created by hugo for deployment. Don't edit, copy to website server. This folder is not synced over to github!
* /static contains my images and files that are linked from other sites.
* /resources folder seems to be generated by hugo, leave alone
* /themes folder should contain the /academic theme/folder with all subfolders. Update that to new version as needed.

# To add new group members
* Copy an existing entry, reformat

# To add new publications 
* add entry to 'mynewbibs.bib' file. Include abstract. Can do that by pulling website article from zotero or through myncbi.
* Run the academic tool for publications: https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/managing-content/
* Make sure folder is not the actual website since we don't want existing pubs overwritten, otherwise they'll loose their special formatting.
* Copy the new entries into the main /publication folder
* Add a pdf to each publication folder with the same name as the folder for that publication
* adjust each index.md to set custom publication type 
* My custom publication types are in layouts/partials/pub_types/
publications.md in content/home describes the different types
To adjust labels/categories for publications, edit a layout file, then adjust numbers in publications:
